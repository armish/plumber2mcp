# This workflow automatically builds and deploys the pkgdown website to GitHub Pages.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Push to main/master: Builds and deploys to gh-pages branch
#   - Pull requests: Builds only (no deployment, for testing)
#   - Releases: Builds and deploys
#   - Manual dispatch: Can be triggered manually from Actions tab
#
# The gh-pages branch will be automatically created on the first successful deployment.
